# OFT
C#, PHP, and R scripts for the Open Field Task project

The C# scripts are for experimental design, procedure, and data collection
The PHP scripts are for communicating with the experiment over the internet and grabbing the data collected within the experiment.
The R script is in the process of being finalized, but concatenates the participant trial data and spits out additional calculated metrics: including k-means and hierarchical clustering, trajectory measures, Standard Deviation of the Ellipses, etc.
