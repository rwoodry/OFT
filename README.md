# OFT
C#, PHP, R, and Python scripts for the Open Field Task project

Open Field Task is now live via this link:
spatialneuroscience.bio.uci.edu/OFT

If you would like to see your results, email me (rwoodry@gmail.com)

The C# scripts are for experimental design, procedure, and data collection

The PHP scripts are for communicating with the experiment over the internet and grabbing the data collected, writing them to .csv files to be backed up to the google drive.

The R scripts are in the process of being finalized, but concatenates the participant trial data and spits out additional calculated metrics: including k-means and hierarchical clustering, trajectory measures, Standard Deviation of the Ellipses, etc. Sumstats and OFT_pathvisualizations provide visualizations for k-cluster snad paths, respectively.

The Python script is for automating the upload of OFT participant's results to the Spatial Neuroscience lab's Google Drive project folder. This effectively backs up the data every hour.
